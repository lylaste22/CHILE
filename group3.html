	<h3>Task Description</h3>
	<p>
		The goal of our team was to develop a classifier of different types for non moving stellar objects.
		Our input data were time series of 20 epochs (4 per night during 5 nights) for star-like sources, 
		we not include extended sources like galaxies, and auxiliary information provided by cross-match 
		with 2MASS survey.  We want to distinguish between variable and non variable objects and then 
		classify subclasses of variable like binaries stars, pulsating stars and non periodic objects 
		like quasars and supernovae. 
	</p>
        <h3>Astronomical Background</h3>
        <p>
Variable stellar objects are sources that change their observable luminosity due to physical changes in their interiors or changes in their environment. This event can be seen and studding through light curves. Inside this classification we can separate between periodic and non periodic events.

<p><b>Periodic:</b> object that shows cyclically changes with time, eclipsing binaries stars and some pulsating stars are part of this class.</p>
<p><b>Non-Periodic:</b> objects that shows random variation in their light curves. In this group we can find QSO, supernovae and microlensing events.</p>
<p><b>QSO:</b> quasi stellar object is a AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei), this objects are galaxies with massive and active black holes in their center and are very energetic events but very distant objects. The irregular interaction between the black hole and surrounding material of the host galaxy produce “random” variation in their brightness.</p>
<p><b>Supernova:</b> is the final end of stellar evolution of massive stars, the events is an explosion which emits large amounts of energy. The brightness of the supernovae increase drastically in the first days and then decrease during several weeks or months. Due to this the shape of the light curve show one big peak of emission.</p>
<p><b>Microlensing:</b> astrophysical events that magnify the brightness of background sources due to the pass of nearest objects in front of the line of sight. This intermediate objects can be stars, moons or planets aligned with the background source.</p>
<p><b>Pulsating Star:</b> are periodic variable stars due to changes in their physical properties. The range of values for period and amplitude is very wide and can cover from 0.2 to 1000 days for period and amplitudes between 0.2 and 10 magnitudes in visual bands. Examples of pulsating stars are Cepheids, Long Period Variables, RR Lyrae , etc.</p>
<p><b>Eclipsing Star:</b> are binaries or multiple systems which are edge on in the line of sight, thus they will eclipse each other at a certain time of their orbits. </p>
