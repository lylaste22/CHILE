	<h3>Task Description</h3>
	<p>The objective of our work was to develop a classifier of different types of astronomical objects.
	To achieve this goal, we count with 25 features including celestial position, flux and ellipticity.
	Our main goal was to discriminate between stars, galaxies, asteroids and artifacts</p>
        For this purpose, we first distinguished between moving and non moving objects using DBSCAN.
        Then, we classified non-moving objects as stars, galaxies or artifacts. Finally, within our moving objects set, we searched for asteroids, using the Hough Transform and DBSCAN. This way, we
        found sources in different epochs which belonged to the same astronomical object.

        <h3>Moving/non-moving object classifier</h3>
        <p>To do the classification between moving and non-moving objects, we ran the DBSCAN clustering algorithm on a dataset which included the detections on all 20 epochs. DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm which puts in the same cluster two elements if they have a distance less than a specific threshold, and it doesn't need the number of clusters as a parameter. In this case, each cluster represented a non-moving astronomical object, while non clustered objects represented a moving object than can either be an asteroid or an artifact. We used 0.003 degrees (about 1.08 arseconds) as the distance threshold parameter for DBSCAN and only considered clusters with at least three samples. </p>

	<h3>Asteroid detection</h3>sources
	<p>Once we already had a dataset of moving-objects, we had to determine when sources of different epochs corresponded to the same astronomical object. To do that, we worked with the asumption that we could aproximate the trajectory of every asteroid to a straight line, and then, search for colinearity between sources. We considered all the lines between pairs of detections using a modified version of Hough Transformation in three dimensions.</p>
